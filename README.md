* PetWork

* Purpose
  PetWork is designed to bring pet owners and freelancing animal lovers together, to help care for
  owners pet(s). Owners can submit jobs to the site, and freelancers can accept them.

* Technologies Used
  PetWork was built with Ruby on Rails, Materialize, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. A few of the gems we used were Devise,
  searchkick, and carrierwave.

* Usage
  A person can use PetWork by signing up for an account. Once their account is setup they can add their pet(s) to
  their profile. From there, they can return to the homepage and search for open jobs in their desired city; or post jobs
  that they need done. If a user finds a job that they want to do, they can change the status to in progress and begin working on the job. Once the job is done, the owner of the job or the freelancer can mark it as complete.
